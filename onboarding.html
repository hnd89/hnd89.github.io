            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Origami is a mobile payment service to provide better shopping experience for both online and at physical stores by connecting consumers and shops. Origami currently achieves this by offering discounts and seamless transaction everytime you pay in store. It also offers optimised recommendations for users, therefore it brings more consumers.<br><br>In order to bring more users in the app we decided to improve our on-boarding UX and most importantly solve existing problem. Since our previous design update, we've seen some major dropout rates during the on-boarding process. To tackle this issue we went on to improve the overall UX of the on-boarding flow.</p>

          <div class="text_frame">
            <h2>Old design / Problem</h2>
            <p>With our current way to signup or signin the verification code method is used in order to make onboarding smooth and faster without typing or deciding the password. After seeing the data and testing with users, we found that some of the email goes into junk mail and some also entering wrong address which resulted in not being able to receive verification code. Those users couldn't signup as there were no fallback way to continue.</p>

            <h2>Product Goal:</h2>
              <ul class="dot">
                <li>Origami has two different aspects which are online shopping and shopping at the physical stores. Whichever you are intending to use whether you are at physical store or starting out at home, on-boarding experience should work for any situations.</li>
                <li>Completing the on-boarding process should be super easy and fast.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="text_frame">
            <h2>KPI:</h2>
            <p>To measure success of the product we monitored how much we can reduce 15% of the daily dropout rate.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="text_frame">
            <h2>Wireframe / UX</h2>
            <p><i><b>Defining main onboarding cases</b></i><br><br>Our main two usecases were either people signing up at the store or not at the store. When they are at the store they are mostly trying to make a payment using Origami app. When they are not at the store we can assume that they came across with the app and trying it out where ever they are. We needed to take these into account and come up with an onboarding experience that provides best experience for both situations. </p>

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p>Based on the problem we saw from the old design we went on to improve the whole process. Below is some of the main variations we discussed with the team.</p>

          <div class="text_frame">
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>In the end, our final outcome was designed to solve the problem where we saw major drop-outs while retaining the existing on-boarding flow for fast and smooth signup/signin. We decided that using the Facebook login for the initial iteration works the best to verify whether fallback option works or not and then we could consider more options in the future releases. We worked in a collaborative environment with engineers, data analysts and product manager to create thoughtful product decisions. We also actively seek out feedback from users and admins to stay in touch with how people are using the product day-to-day.</p>
