            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>At early phase, Origami was an online shopping service where you can discover various unique products and brands. As of late 2015 it began to shift it's focus on mobile payment service to improve the offline shopping experience. As a company we defined our long term vision for what the product should become and how it can help improve people's everyday shopping. Our primary goal was to connect consumers and shops through better CRM and making purchase experience better by providing more incentive for our users everytime anytime. In order to achieve this we needed to evolve our product and initially simplify the consumer experience by optimising the payment interface while educating users about the discounts at available stores.</p>
            <h2>Objective:</h2>
              <ul class="dot">
                <p>In the initial phase we needed to consider many conditions as we did not have such a great store volumes to offer, however these are the significant points that we took into account in order to create a best experience for our users with our store volumes at that time:</p><br>
                <li>Focus on showing selected content rather than showing everything.</li>
                <li>Tailor content by learning from users' attributes and charactoristics over time.</li>
                <li>Provide many types of content so that we can learn which content is more useful over time. We can use this knowledge to then build a better shop discovery feature (once we have greater shop volume) as we will know which stores resinate with people the most.</li>

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p><italic>Early web experiment that didn't work</italic><br><br>It turns out that we couldn't provide best content with this design as it only shows one type of category in single view and takes an effort to switch between categories. Verticle list view could show more stores at once, however with the existing store volume it was not the design that worked. Through internal testing and interviewing people outside we also found that list view with the text heavy information only works when people are looking for something more specific but less likely to work when browsing for the first time.</p>

            <p>UI & UX brainstorming<br><br>Learning from prior experiment with a quick web prototype we decided to explore more with an interface that's able to show as many categories as possible and less text but more images to make it intriguing. This way we can curate and focus on the high quality content in a single page. Our intension was to make this feature as effortless as possible while showing the most valuable content for our users.</p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>We decided it made most sense to make each sections corousel to have various categories in a single page so it shows few most interesting content from each of them. As people have different preferences and interests, we also used cobination of geo-location and data from users such as Viewed stores, whether they are Male/Female and Purchased history to tailor content for each users. </p>
