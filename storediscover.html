            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>At early phase, Origami was an online shopping service where you can discover various unique products and brands. As of late 2015 it began to shift it's focus on mobile payment service to improve the buying and selling experience in the physical stores. As a company we defined our long term vision for what the product should become and how it can help improve people's everyday purchases. Our primary goal was to connect consumers and shops by providing better CRM tools and using users' attributes/charactoristics to provide accurate recommendations for discovering local stores. We also wanted to create better deals for consumers everytime they make purchases. In order to achieve this we needed to evolve our product and initially simplify the consumer experience by optimising the payment interface while educating users about the discounts at available stores.</p>
            <h2>Product Goal:</h2>
              <ul class="dot">
                <p>In the initial phase we needed to consider many conditions as we did not have such a great store volumes to offer, however these are the significant points that we took into account in order to create a best experience for our users with our store volumes at that time:</p><br>
                <li>Focus on showing selected content rather than showing everything.</li>
                <li>Tailor content by learning from users' attributes and charactoristics over time.</li>
                <li>Provide many types of content so that we can learn which content is more useful over time. We can use this knowledge to then build a better shop discovery feature (once we have greater shop volume) as we will know which stores resinate with people the most.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>KPI:</h2>
            <p>To measure it's success, we simply looked at the elevation of transactions made at different stores per user(Unique transaction per user).</p>

          <div class="text_frame">
            <h2>Wireframe & UX</h2>
            <p>In order to define our UX we first thought about the user story, how people actually discover stores through our app and until they reach into stores.</p>

            <h2>Exploration</h2>
            <p><i>Early web experiment that didn't work</i><br><br>Through testing and interviewing with people, it turns out that we couldn't provide best content with the initial experiment for two main reasons. First reason is that it only shows one type of category in a single view and the friction to switch between the categories. Second reason is that the list view with text heavy content works better when people are looking for something more specific but less likely to work when browsing for the first time.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="text_frame">
            <p>UI & UX brainstorming<br><br>Learning from prior experiment we decided to explore more with an interface that's able to show as many categories as possible and less text but more images to make it intriguing. This way we can curate and focus on the high quality content in a single page. Our intension was to make this feature as effortless as possible while showing the most valuable content for our users. We explored alot with different layouts and interactions including map, list, side scroll and alot more in order to figure out the best way to show our content.</p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p><i><b>Store discovery content</b></i><br><br>We decided it made most sense to show contents in the corousel UI as it enabled us to show various categories in a single view. As people have different preferences and interests, we also used cobination of geo-location and data from users such as viewed stores, Male/Female and purchased history to tailor content for respective users.</p>
            <p><i><b>Navigation</b></i><br><br>We also combined all payment related features and the store discovery in the first tab for the initial release as we wanted to make our app more focused on the payment experience. This way it enabled us to educate our users about the payment feature as well as the available stores nearby.</p>
