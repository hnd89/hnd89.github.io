            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>Origami has evolved over time and began to focus on mobile payment service to improve how people shop at the store by offering better incentive and experience for the consumers. In order to achieve this we needed to evolve our product and simplify the consumer experience to support multiple methods of payment while educating customers about the discounts at available stores. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Objective:</h2>
              <ul class="dot">
                In the initial phase we needed to consider many conditions as we did not have such a great stores volumes to offer, however these are the significant points that we took into account in order to create a best experience for our users with our store volumes at that time:<br><br>
                <li>Focus on showing the best content rather than showing everything.</li>
                <li>Primarily we should have the control of our curated content.</li>
                <li>Manage content accordingly to your area and interest. Static content does not work for everyone.</li>
                <li>Make sure to offer many type of content so that we can learn which content is more useful over time. We can use this knowledge to then build a better shop discovery feature (once we have greater shop volume) as we will know which stores resinate with people the most.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2>Collaboration:</h2>
            <p>I mainly worked with my co-product designer Jonathon Toon, 1 iOS, 1 android, 2 backend engineers, 1 data engineer, and 1 marketing specialist to build this product. We also involved other teams when needed to get further input.</p>
