            <p>Foodriends is a fun little concept app that connects people with similar food tastes among local areas. Whether you are looking for people to go grab some food/coffee with or make new friends in new place through similar food interest this app will help you connect with people arounds you in more casual and fun way. While you can connect with people through similar food interests, it also provides optimised recommendation based on the places you liked and as a result you can discover a lot more places you will love. <br><br> I come up with this idea from Tabelog app which has so much useful local restaurant data and where people want to go and went. It would be so much more useful if it can be used for the recommendation while it can also be used to connect people through their respective interest.</p>
