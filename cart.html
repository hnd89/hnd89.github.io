            <p><h1><b>Designing the cart feature and improving the purchase flow</b></h1></p>
            <p>As a fast growing commerce platform, purchasing product is core of the Origami experience. When the last version was designed a few years ago, the number of purchases and use cases were substantially different than today. In this design update, our focus was to optimize for faster and easier transaction throughout the purchase flow, and also to enable multiple purchases at once. As a result, I helped enable users to purchase multiple products without being charged for extra shipping fee for each transactions. By improving the purchase flow, I helped reduce existing friction and dropout rates.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Collaboration:</h2>
            <p>I was the sole designer on this project with 1 frontend and 3 backend engineers with regular catch up meetings once a week for the implementation stage. During the design process, I held regular feedback session with the product team where we brainstormed and critiqued which helped me improve my design.</p>

            <h2>Old version of the purchase flow:</h2>
            <p>To kickstart the process, we collaborated with customer support team and data analyst to understand in which part users dropout or struggle to proceed during their attempt to complete their purchase. We learned that many people had trouble finding where to select size/color and quantity, which resulted in buying wrong item. Dropout rate was increasing as it gets closer to the final confirmation with the existing multiple steps. </p>

            <h2>High fidelity Mockup</h2>
            <p>After figuring out the problem and sketching many rough ideas, I came up with simple flows and visual refresh of the feature. I narrowed them down to 3 main variations based on the feedback and pursuing simplest flow which solves the existing problem.
              <br><br>Variation 1: Having "Add to cart" as the primary action and choosing whether to continue shopping or checkout cart item.
              <br><br>Variation 2: Having "Add to cart" as the primary action but enabling instant checkout as well as adding to cart. Proceeding to checkout will include the items that was originally in the cart.
              <br><br>Variation 3: Keeping the existing instant purchase flow which only includes the item you are currently trying to purchase. "Add to cart" will add item to the cart and multiple items can be purchased via inside the cart view.

            <h2>New version of the purchase flow:</h2>
            <p><b>1, 2. You should be able to know imidiately how to select Size/Color/Quantity.</b> To do this we made this view merely focused on selecting these options without any other information with simple half modal view.
            <br><br><b>3. After selecting Size/Color/Quantity you should be able get to the final step as quick and easy as possible.</b> For this we removed all the steps we previously had to get to the final step by integrating Shipping address/Payment method all in a single page, so that it mentally feels less step and obvious exactly what you need to complete purchase.</p>
