            <p><h1><b>Designing the cart feature and improving the purchase flow</b></h1></p>
            <p>As a fast growing commerce platform, purchasing product is core of Origami experience. When the last version was designed a few years ago, the number of users and purchases were substantially different than today. <br><br>With the rise of purchases we set out to update the design in order to support multiple purchases with one checkout, and provide better shipping rate to improve their shopping experience.<br><br>With this design update, weâ€™ve successfully increased a purchase frequency and speed by optimizing the flow and enabling multiple item purchase.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Collaboration:</h2>
            <p>I was the sole designer on this project with 1 frontend and 3 backend engineers with regular catch up meetings once a week for the implementation stage. During the design process, I held regular feedback session with the product team including the customer support where we brainstormed and critiqued which helped me improve my design.</p>

            <h2>Old version of purchase flow (The problem):</h2>
            <p>To kickstart the process, we collaborated with customer support and data analyst to understand where users dropout or struggle to proceed during their attempt to complete their purchase. We learned that many people had trouble selecting/finding size/color and quantity, which resulted in buying wrong item. Dropout rate was also increasing as it gets closer to final step(complete payment). People were also often making separate purchases from the same store within a short time frame which required separate transaction and shipping fee.</p>

            <h2>Brainstorming and wireframing</h2>
            <p>Before we get into any wireframing, we brainstormed everything that could be affected by the cart integration including the engineering team. Here is some of the major considerations we taken into account:<br><br><b>- Merchant console will be affected by enabling multiple purchase<br>- Shipping fee will be affected by enabling multiple purchase<br>- Time of delivery will be affected by enabling multiple purchases<br>- Confirmation/receipt emails will be affected by enabling multiple purchase<br>- Order history will be affected by enabling multiple purchase<br>- Total receiving points will be affected by enabling multiple purchase </b></p>

            <h2>High fidelity Mockup</h2>
            <p>After figuring out the problem and sketching many rough ideas, I came up with simple flows and visual refresh of the feature. I narrowed them down to 3 main variations based on the feedback and pursuing simplest flow which solves the existing problem.
              <br><br><b>Variation 1:</b> Add item to the cart and choose to continue shopping or checkout existing items inside the cart from the same shop.
              <br><br><b>Variation 2:</b> Add item to the cart, or "Checkout" to instantly checkout with the existing items inside a cart from the same shop.
              <br><br><b>Variation 3:</b> Add item to the cart, or "Checkout" to instantly checkout with a single item.

            <h2>Approach and solution</h2>
            <p><b>1. You should be able to imidiately know how to select "Size" "Color" "Quantity".</b> To do this we made this view merely focused on selecting these options without showing any additional information by simple half modal view. For the checkout process, we intent to keep existing instant checkout and made "Add to cart" as a separate flow so that you can purchase item quickly without additional step and use cart when needed.</p>

            <p><b>2. Instant checkout <br><br>After selecting "Size" "Color" "Quantity" you should be able get to the final step as quick and easy as possible.</b> For this we reduced the steps by merging the "Shipping address" and "Payment method" screens in a single page to make them feel effortless. We've also simplified some of the elements by removing excess titles and cells to reduce unnecessary decision making.</p>
