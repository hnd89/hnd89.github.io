            <p><h1><b>Designing the new Origami profiles</b></h1></p>
            <p>As a fast growing commerce platform, purchasing product is core of the Origami experience. When the last version was designed a few years ago, the number of purchases and use cases were substantially different than today. In this design update, our focus was to optimize for faster and easier transaction throughout the purchase flow, and also to enable multiple purchases at once. As a result, I helped enable users to purchase multiple products without being charged for extra shipping fee for each transactions. By improving the purchase flow, I helped reduce existing friction and dropout rates.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Collaboration:</h2>
            <p>I was the sole designer on this project with 1 frontend and 3 backend engineers with regular catch up meetings once a week for the implementation stage. During the design process, I held regular feedback session with the product team where we brainstormed and critiqued which helped me improve my design.</p>
